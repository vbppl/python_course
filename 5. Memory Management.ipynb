If two variables have the same value, then they should point to the same memory location (reference) rather than having multiple copies of the same data in memory.\n",

    "> - Not all strings are interned, strings with spaces or special characters are not interned by default.\n",
    "> - String formed with any other way other then direct assignment like concatenation or formatting will not be interned.\n",
    "> - You can explicitly intern strings using the `sys.intern()` function from the `sys` module.\n",
