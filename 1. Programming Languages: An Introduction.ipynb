    "# **Programming Languages: An Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are tools that allow us to communicate with computers. They are a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do. Just like other human languages, they have their own set of rules (Grammar), Syntax, and Semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to give instructions for a complex task. With humans, you can use gestures, context, and handle ambiguity. Computers, however, need absolute precision. That's where **programming languages** come in. They are formal, structured languages designed specifically for us to provide unambiguous instructions to computers, telling them exactly what to do.\n",

    "## **Syntax vs. Semantics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Language and Programming languages have two important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**: These are the grammatical rules that define how statements must be structured and written in a programming language. If the syntax is wrong, the computer simply won't understand the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **Example (In English)**:\n",
    "\t\t- ‚úÖ Correct syntax: `\"The cat sat on the mat.\"`\n",
    "\t\t- ‚ùå Incorrect syntax: `\"Sat mat the on cat.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **Example (In Python)**:\n",
    "\t\t- ‚úÖ Correct syntax: `print(\"Hello, World!\")`\n",
    "\t\t- ‚ùå Incorrect syntax: `print(\"Hello, World!\"` # Missing closing parenthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantics**: This refers to the *meaning* behind a syntactically correct statement. It's about what the instruction actually *does* when the computer executes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **Example (In English)**:\n",
    "\t    - ‚úÖ `\"The cat chased the dog.\"` vs. ‚úÖ `\"The dog chased the cat.\"`  \n",
    "    \tBoth sentences have correct syntax but different meanings.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- **Example (In Python)**:\n",
    "\t\t- ‚úÖ `\"print(5 + 3)\"` vs. ‚úÖ `\"print(5 - 3)\"`\n",
