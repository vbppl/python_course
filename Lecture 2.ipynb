    "# **Introduction to Python 🐍**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [**high level**](#high-level-language), [**dynamically typed**](#dynamically-typed-language), [**strongly typed**](#strongly-typed-language) and [**interpreted**](#interpreted-language) programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**. It's widely popular due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility.\n",

    "## **Key Features of Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore Python's main features in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **High Level Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level language provides a greater level of abstraction from machine code, making it easier for humans to read, write, and understand. It allows programmers to write instructions in a more human-readable form, using words and symbols closer to natural language. This enables them to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with low-level hardware details such as memory management or instruction sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, code written in a high-level language is portable, it can often run on different systems and hardware platforms without modification. This means the same program can work on computers with different CPUs, memory sizes, or operating systems, as long as there's a compatible compiler or interpreter available. The abstraction hides hardware-specific details, allowing greater flexibility and reusability across devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Abstraction is the process of hiding complex details while exposing only the necessary parts or what's important. It helps reduce programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "- **Analogy:** \n",
    "\t- Using a car: You don’t need to know how the engine works to drive it. You just need the steering wheel, pedals, and gear.\n",
    "\t- Using a smartphone: You tap an app to make a call without needing to understand the underlying technology that connects you to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can add two numbers using the + operator and display the result using the print() function, without worrying about how the addition is actually performed by the CPU or how the result is displayed on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adding two numbers in Python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "sum = a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sum:\", sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Sum: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, Python handles all the underlying tasks, such as memory allocation and arithmetic operations at the hardware level, allowing you to focus solely on the logic of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Comparison with a Low Level Language:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A low-level language is more closely related to machine code. It requires a deep understanding of the computer's architecture and hardware, making it more complex and hardware dependent.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In assembly language if you are writing any programme you have to manage registers, memory addresses, and specific instructions for the CPU you are programming for. And programme for one CPU architecture may not work on another.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```assembly\n",
    "> ; Assembly code to add two numbers in Intel 8086\n",
    "> MOV AX, 10 ; Move 10 into register AX\n",
    "> MOV BX, 20 ; Move 20 into register BX\n",
    "> ADD AX, BX ; Add AX and BX\n",
    "> ; Result is now in AX\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this example, to add 2 no's in assembly language you have to manage registers and memory addresses directly, which makes the code less readable and more complex. You also need to know the specific CPU architecture like in this case it is Intel 8086. This code is only work for this specific CPU architecture. If you want to run this code on another CPU architecture, you have to rewrite the code according to that architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamically Typed Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamically typed language is a programming language in which you don’t need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The type of a variable is determined at runtime, based on the value it holds. You can also change the type of a variable later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dynamically typed variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "number = 10          # integer\n",
    "pi = 3.14            # float\n",
    "text = \"Hello\"       # string\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Number:\", number)\n",
    "print(type(number))\n",
    "print(\"Pi:\", pi)\n",
    "print(type(pi))\n",
    "print(\"Text:\", text)\n",
    "print(type(text))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing the type of 'number'\n",
    "number = \"Now I'm a string!\"\n",
    "print(\"Number:\", number)\n",
    "print(type(number))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Number: 10\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "Pi: 3.14\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    "Text: Hello\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "Number: Now I'm a string!\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python example, the variable number is initially assigned an integer value, so Python automatically treats number as an integer. Later, it is reassigned to a string value without any error, demonstrating Python’s dynamic typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type() function is used to display the data type of the variable at different points in the code, showing how the type changes based on the value assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Strongly Typed Language**\n",
    "A strongly typed language is a programming language that enforces strict rules about how data types can be used. In a strongly typed language, you cannot perform operations on incompatible types without explicit conversion. This helps prevent errors and makes the code more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adding two incompatible types in Python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = \"20\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding an integer and a string\n",
    "result = a + b  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, Python raises a TypeError because you are trying to add an integer (a) and a string (b) together. Python does not allow this operation without explicit conversion, which is a characteristic of strongly typed languages.\n",
    "In contrast, in a weakly typed language, you might be able to perform such operations without an error, but the result may not be what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### **Weakly Typed Language**\n",
    "> A weakly typed language is a programming language that allows more flexibility in how data types are used. In a weakly typed language, you can perform operations on incompatible types without explicit conversion, which can lead to unexpected results or errors.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```javascript\n",
    "> // Adding an integer and a string in JavaScript\n",
    "> let a = 10; // integer\n",
    "> let b = \"20\"; // string\n",
    "> \n",
    "> // Adding an integer and a string\n",
    "> let result = a + b;\n",
    ">\n",
    "> console.log(result);\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Output:**\n",
    "> ```javascript\n",
    "> \"1020\"\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this JavaScript example, the variable a is an integer and b is a string. When you add them together, JavaScript converts the integer to a string and concatenates them, resulting in \"1020\". This behavior can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with your data types.\n",
    "> In this example, JavaScript allows you to add an integer and a string together without raising an error. Instead, it converts the integer to a string and concatenates them, resulting in \"1020\". This behavior can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with your data types.\n",
    "> In contrast, in a strongly typed language like Python, you would get a TypeError if you tried to perform the same operation without explicit conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpreted Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreted language is a programming language where code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, instead of being converted into machine code beforehand like in compiled languages, which makes debugging and testing faster and easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "a = 10 + b\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### <span style=\"color:red\"> NameError: name 'b' is not defined </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the Python interpreter executes the first line and in secons line it prints value of a which is `10`. When it reaches the third line, it encounters an error because `b` is not defined. The interpreter stops execution at this point, allowing you to fix the error before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### **Compare Python with C++**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> C++ is a [**high-level**](#High-level-language), [**statically-typed**](#Statically-typed-language), [**strongly typed**](#strongly-typed-language), [**compiled-language**](#Compiled-language).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### **Statically Typed Language**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A programming language in which you have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it. This is typical in languages like C and C++. The type of the variable is bound to a data type during compilation time and cannot be changed later. This ensures type safety and can prevent certain types of errors during development.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```cpp\n",
    "> #include <iostream>\n",
    "> #include <string>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> int main()\n",
    "> {\n",
    ">    int number = 10;        // 'number' is declared as an int\n",
    ">    double pi = 3.14;       // 'pi' is declared as a double\n",
    ">    std::string text = \"Hello\";  // 'text' is declared as a string\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    // If you try Redeclaring the variable number with a different type.\n",
    ">    // number = \"Now I'm a string!\"; // Uncommenting this line will cause a compile-time error.\n",
    ">     cout << \"Number: \" << number << endl;\n",
    ">     cout << \"Pi: \" << pi << endl;\n",
    ">     cout << \"Text: \" << text << endl;\n",
    ">     // This line will print the text variable\n",
    ">     return 0;\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Output:**\n",
    "> ```cpp\n",
    "> Number: 10  \n",
    "> Pi: 3.14  \n",
    "> Text: Hello  \n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you uncomment `number = \"This is not an int\";` and run the code, you will get the following \n",
    "> ##### <span style=\"color:red\"> error: invalid conversion from ‘const char*’ to ‘int’ </span>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `a value of type \"const char *\" cannot be assigned to an entity of type \"int\"`\n",
    ">\t\n",
    "> This error during compilation shows that C++ is a statically typed language, as you are trying to assign a string type value to an int type variable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### **Compiled language**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A compiled language is a programming language where the source code is translated into machine code (or sometimes intermediate code) by a compiler before runtime (execution). Once the code is compiled, the resulting machine code can be directly executed by the computer without needing the original source code at runtime.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The main benefit of compiled languages is that, after the code is compiled, you get a standalone executable file that can be run multiple times. This file does not require the original source code, nor does it need to be recompiled every time it is run. In the case of C++, the executable file is typically in the format of an .out file (on Linux/macOS) or .exe file (on Windows).\n",

    "### **The main features of Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**. Python is known for its clear and readable syntax, which resembles English to a certain extent.\n",
    "- **Easy to learn**. Python’s readability makes it relatively easy for beginners to pick up the language and understand what the code is doing.\n",
    "- **Versatility**. Python is not limited to one type of task; you can use it in many fields. Whether you're interested in web development, automating tasks, or diving into data science, Python has the tools to help you get there.\n",
    "- **Rich library support**. It comes with a large standard library that includes pre-written code for various tasks, saving you time and effort. Additionally, Python's vibrant community has developed thousands of third-party packages, which extend Python's functionality even further.\n",
    "- **Platform independence**. One of the great things about Python is that you can write your code once and run it on any operating system. This feature makes Python a great choice if you're working on a team with different operating systems.\n",
    "- **Interpreted language**. Python is an interpreted language, which means the code is executed line by line. This can make debugging easier because you can test small pieces of code without having to compile the whole program.\n",
    "- **Open source and free**. It’s also an open-source language, which means its source code is freely available and can be distributed and modified. This has led to a large community of developers contributing to its development and creating a vast ecosystem of Python libraries.\n",
    "- **Dynamically typed**. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare the data type of a variable when you create it. The Python interpreter infers the type, which makes the code more flexible and easy to work with.\n",
