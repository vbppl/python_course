    "## Tokens (Lexical Units)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are the smallest units of a program that are meaningful to the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, tokens include Keywords, Identifiers, Operators, Literals and Punctuators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keywords**: Reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    in the above example, `print` is a keyword, used to print the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n",
    "    Examples: `if`, `print`, `else`, `elseif`, `import`, `while`, `def`, `return`, `for`, `in`, `is`, `and`, `or`, `not` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > In python, keywords are case-sensitive.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > For example: `if` and `If` are different.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > `if` is a keyword,\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > but `If` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifiers**: Names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_integer = 10\n",
    "    my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "    my_float = 10.5\n",
    "    my_boolean = True\n",

    "    my_dictionary = {\"name\": \"Jamyang\", \"age\": 20}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    > In python, to name an identifier, we need to follow some rules:\n",
    "    > - An identifier maximum length is 79 characters.\n",
    "    > - An identifier must start with a letter (`a` - `z`, `A` - `Z`) or underscore (`_`).\n",
    "    > - An identifier can contain letters, digits (`0` - `9`) and underscores.\n",
    "    > - An identifier cannot contain special characters like `@`, `$`, `%`, `-`, `+`, `=`, `&`, `|`, `~`, `!`, `#`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*` etc.\n",
    "    > - An identifier cannot be a reserved word.\n",
    "    > - In python, identifiers are case-sensitive. i.e `my_integer` and `MyInteger` are different identifiers.\n",
    "    > - **Note**: It's a good practice to use lowercase letters for identifiers.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    >> Valid Identifiers: `my_integer`, `_name`, `name1`, `name_1`, `name_1_2`, `name_1_2_3`, etc.\n",
    "    >>\n",
    "    >> Non Valid Identifiers: `1my_integer`, `my-string`, `my float`, etc.\n",
